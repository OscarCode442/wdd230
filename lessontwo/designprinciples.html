                            The rule of thirds is a composition guideline that places your subject in 
                            the left or right third of an image, leaving the other two thirds more open.
                            While there are other forms of composition, the rule of thirds generally leads to 
                            compelling and well-composed shots.

                        Hick’s Law is a simple idea that says that the more choices you present your users with, 
                        the longer it will take them to reach a decision. It’s common sense, but often neglected in the rush to cram 
                        too much functionality into a site or application. As a designer, you will use Hick’s 
                        Law to examine how many functions you should offer at any part of your website and how this will affect your users’ overall 
                        approach to decision making.

              <p>
                Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. 
                Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. 
                By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users’ perceptions and guide them 
                to desired actions.
